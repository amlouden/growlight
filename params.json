You'll need\r\ninstalled SPL/ZFS libraries. You'll be using the include files from the\r\ncheckout, since by default using the SPL headers hides the real system headers.\r\nUnfortunately, the headers I've copied into libzfs/ in the checkout quite\r\nlikely don't match yours. Have fun!\r\n\r\n env CFLAGS=\"-I`pwd`/libzfs\" LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/lib\" ./configure --enable-zfs\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
